## Development Workflow

### Sprint Management
- **Sprint Duration**: 1 week cycles
- **On-site Days**: Mondays and Thursdays
  - Full day work sessions with direct team communication
  - Sprint planning, backlog refinement, and product discussions
- **Remote Days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday
  - Discord-based communication for progress assessment
  - Task distribution and coordination
  - Daily standups via Discord

### Communication Channels
- **On-site**: Face-to-face collaboration and planning
- **Remote**: Discord for daily check-ins and task updates

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Pipeline Steps
1. **Code Commit** → Git repository
2. **Automated Testing** → Unit tests execution
3. **Code Quality Checks** → Linting and static analysis
4. **Build Generation** → APK/AAB creation
5. **Release Preparation** → Version tagging and release notes

### Deployment Triggers
- **Feature Implementation**: Major feature completions trigger release candidates
- **Release Process**: 
  - Create release with detailed description
  - Version update on project website
  - Distribution through appropriate channels

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
- **Main Branch**: `main` - Production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/issue-number-description`
- **Release Branches**: `release/version-number`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/issue-description`

### Branch Management
- One branch per issue/specification
- Feature isolation for parallel development
- Organized folder/code division by specification area
- Each team member works on their assigned specification branch

## Build Process

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Latest stable version)
- Kotlin compiler
- SQLite database setup
- Jetpack Compose dependencies

### Build Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure Android Studio and dependencies
2. **Code Compilation**: Kotlin compilation with error checking
3. **Resource Processing**: UI resources and assets compilation
4. **Database Migration**: SQLite schema validation
5. **APK Generation**: Final application package creation

## Release Management

### Version Control
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Git tags for each release
- Changelog maintenance for each version

### Release Types
- **Development Builds**: Internal testing and development
- **Beta Releases**: Feature testing with limited users
- **Production Releases**: Public app store distribution

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Version number incremented
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] APK signed and verified

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
```bash
# Required tools
- Android Studio (Latest)
- Git
- Kotlin plugin
- Android SDK (API level as per project requirements)
```

### Database Setup
- SQLite database initialization
- Migration scripts for schema updates
- Test data seeding for development

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Process
- **Schedule**: Every Monday
- **Scope**: Functionality verification and code quality
- **Requirements**: 
  - Feature completeness validation
  - Code style adherence
  - Performance considerations
  - Security review

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Automated testing for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **UI Tests**: User interface and user experience testing
- **Manual Testing**: Feature verification and edge case testing

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Code review approval required
- Documentation updates mandatory
- Performance benchmarks met

## Deployment Environments

### Development
- Local development environment
- Frequent builds for testing
- Debug configurations enabled

### Staging
- Pre-production testing environment
- Release candidate validation
- Performance testing

### Production
- Live application environment
- Stable releases only
- Monitoring and analytics enabled
