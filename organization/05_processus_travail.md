# Work Process Description

## Overview

The Homeal project work process is organized around **short one-week sprints** with a hybrid methodology combining on-site and remote work. The organization prioritizes direct communication and agile coordination.

## Work Methodology

### Sprint Management
- **Sprint Duration**: 1 week
- **Rhythm**: Short cycles for rapid feedback and adaptation
- **Planning**: Weekly planning and review

### Weekly Organization

#### On-Site Days: Monday and Thursday
- **Full work sessions** with direct team communication
- **Sprint planning** and backlog refinement
- **Product discussions** and decision making
- **Code reviews** and pair programming sessions
- **Real-time blocker resolution**

#### Remote Days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday
- **Discord communication** for progress assessment
- **Task distribution and coordination**
- **Daily standups** via Discord
- **Individual work** on assigned tasks

### Communication Channels
- **On-site**: Face-to-face collaboration and planning
- **Remote**: Discord for daily check-ins and task updates

## Git Flow and Version Management

### Branching Strategy

#### Branch Structure
- **Main branch**: `main` - Production-ready code
- **Feature branches**: `feature/issue-number-description`
- **Release branches**: `release/version-number`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/issue-description`

#### Branch Management
- **One branch per issue/specification**
- **Feature isolation** for parallel development
- **Organized division** by folder/code according to specification domain
- **Each team member** works on their assigned specification branch

### Git Workflow

#### Feature Development
1. **Branch creation** from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/123-fridge-management
   ```

2. **Development and commits**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(fridge): add ingredient scanning functionality"
   git push origin feature/123-fridge-management
   ```

3. **Pull Request and Review**
   - Create PR to `main`
   - Mandatory code review
   - Passing automated tests
   - Functional validation

4. **Merge and cleanup**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/123-fridge-management
   ```

### Naming Conventions

#### Branches
- `feature/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
- `bugfix/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
- `hotfix/[critical-issue-description]`
- `release/[version-number]`

#### Commit Messages
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation
- `style`: formatting, no logic change
- `refactor`: code refactoring
- `test`: adding/modifying tests
- `chore`: maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat(scan): implement barcode scanning functionality
fix(database): resolve SQLite connection leak
docs(api): update controller documentation
```

## Quality Assurance Process

### Code Review
- **Schedule**: Every Monday
- **Scope**: Functionality verification and code quality
- **Requirements**:
  - Feature completeness validation
  - Code style adherence
  - Performance considerations
  - Security review

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Code review approval required
- Documentation updates mandatory
- Performance benchmarks met

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Automated testing of core functionality
- **Integration tests**: Component interaction validation
- **UI tests**: User interface and user experience testing
- **Manual testing**: Feature verification and edge cases

## Project Management

### Work Breakdown
- **Division by specification**: Each member responsible for a domain
- **GitHub Issues**: Granular task tracking
- **Milestones**: Clearly defined sprint objectives
- **Labels**: Issue categorization (bug, feature, documentation, etc.)

### Progress Tracking
- **Daily standups** (Discord):
  - What was done yesterday
  - What will be done today
  - Identified blockers

- **Sprint reviews** (on-site):
  - Demonstration of developed features
  - Feedback and adjustments
  - Next sprint planning

### Risk Management
- **Early identification** of technical blockers
- **Proactive communication** of difficulties
- **Mutual support** during on-site sessions
- **Rapid escalation** of critical issues

## Tools and Environment

### Development Tools
- **IDE**: Android Studio (latest stable version)
- **Version control**: Git with GitHub
- **Communication**: Discord for remote work
- **Project management**: GitHub Issues and Projects

### Development Environment
```bash
# Minimum required configuration
- Android Studio (latest version)
- Git
- Kotlin plugin
- Android SDK (API level as per project requirements)
```

### Code Standards
- **Formatter**: Shared Android Studio configuration
- **Linting**: Ktlint for consistency
- **Documentation**: KDoc for public functions
- **Architecture**: Respect defined patterns

## Deployment and Delivery

### Build Types
- **Development builds**: Internal testing and development
- **Beta releases**: Feature testing with limited users
- **Production releases**: Public app store distribution

### Release Process
1. **Code finalization** on release branch
2. **Complete testing** and QA validation
3. **Signed APK/AAB generation**
4. **Release documentation** and changelog
5. **Git tag** and GitHub release creation
6. **Project website update**

### **CI/CD Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **GitHub Actions**: Not configured yet
- **Automated Testing**: Not set up yet
- **Build Automation**: Not implemented yet
- **Dependency**: Requires Android project creation first

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

### Performance Indicators
- **Sprint velocity**: Completed story points
- **Cycle time**: Issue creation ‚Üí resolution
- **Code quality**: Test coverage, discovered defects
- **Team satisfaction**: Regular process feedback

### Retrospectives
- **Frequency**: End of each sprint
- **Format**: Open discussion on what works/doesn't work
- **Actions**: Continuous process improvement
- **Documentation**: Capture lessons learned

## Current Process Status

### ‚úÖ Elements in Place
- Defined and documented Git workflow
- Hybrid communication structure
- Sprint planning framework
- Code review standards
- Repository setup and branch structure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Elements to Implement
- Issue tracker configured with labels
- PR and issue templates
- Complete CI/CD automation
- Defined performance metrics
- **Android Studio project creation** (prerequisite for development workflow)

### ‚ùå Blocked Until Android Setup
- Code review workflow (no code to review yet)
- Testing automation (no tests to run yet)
- Build and deployment processes (no app to build yet)

### üîÑ Evolving Processes
- Practice refinement based on team feedback
