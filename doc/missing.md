# Missing

This file details all things we are missing and didn't have time to implement yet.
None of these are particularly complicated but we lacked the time to do them.

The specs were really ambitious and would have been feasable if we already knew
the android stack we chose to work with.

- Full integration of the recommendation system into the main app. The server
works, but the client side is not integrated.
- Expiration dates for owned ingredients.
- Popup window to add quantity when validating an ingredient in the shopping list.
- Database could be cleaned up but it would require manual work.
