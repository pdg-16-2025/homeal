# CI/CD Setup for Homeal Android App

## Overview
This document describes the complete CI/CD pipeline setup for the Homeal Android application using GitHub Actions.

## Features

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Run on every push to main branch and PR
- **Lint Checks**: Automated code quality analysis
- **Test Reports**: Detailed test results with pass/fail status
- **Pull Request Validation**: Automatic checks on PRs with status comments

### Automated Building
- **Debug APK**: Built on every successful test run
- **Release APK**: Built automatically on version tags
- **Build Artifacts**: APKs uploaded and available for download
- **Build Caching**: Gradle dependencies cached for faster builds

### Release Management
- **Tag-based Releases**: Create releases by pushing version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Automatic Versioning**: Version code and name updated automatically
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatic creation with APK attachments
- **Semantic Versioning**: Following `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` format

## File Structure

```
.github/workflows/
â”œâ”€â”€ android-ci.yml       # Main CI pipeline (tests, build, lint)
â””â”€â”€ android-release.yml  # Release pipeline (triggered by tags)

scripts/
â””â”€â”€ android-dev.sh      # Development helper script

android/
â”œâ”€â”€ build.gradle.kts    # Enhanced with test dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ app/build.gradle.kts # Updated with test configuration
â””â”€â”€ gradle/libs.versions.toml # Updated with testing libraries
```

## Workflows

### 1. Android CI (`android-ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to `main` or `develop`, PRs to `main`

**Jobs**:
- `test`: Run unit tests with detailed reporting
- `build`: Build debug APK after successful tests
- `lint`: Run Android lint checks

### 2. Android Release (`android-release.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push tags matching `v*` pattern

**Jobs**:
- `release`: Full release pipeline including:
  - Test execution
  - Version number updates
  - Release and debug APK builds
  - GitHub release creation
  - APK attachment to release



## ðŸ›  Development Tools

### Enhanced Testing Setup
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies
- **Truth**: Google's fluent assertion library
- **Coroutines Test**: For testing Kotlin coroutines
- **Architecture Testing**: For testing Android Architecture Components

### Development Script (`scripts/android-dev.sh`)
Quick commands for common tasks:

```bash
# Run tests
./scripts/android-dev.sh test

# Build debug APK
./scripts/android-dev.sh build

# Create a release
./scripts/android-dev.sh release v1.0.0

# Simulate CI locally
./scripts/android-dev.sh ci-local

# Clean project
./scripts/android-dev.sh clean
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Make development script executable
chmod +x scripts/android-dev.sh

# Setup project dependencies
./scripts/android-dev.sh setup
```

### 2. Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Run unit tests
./scripts/android-dev.sh test

# Run all tests (requires connected device/emulator)
./scripts/android-dev.sh test-all
```

### 3. Creating Your First Release
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull

# Create and push a release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The release workflow will automatically:
1. Run all tests
2. Build release APKs
3. Create a GitHub release
4. Attach APK files to the release

## Best Practices

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/description`

### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and edge cases

### Release Process
1. Develop features on feature branches
2. Create PR to `develop` branch
3. Merge to `develop` for integration testing
4. Create PR from `develop` to `main`
5. After merge to `main`, create release tag

### Version Numbering
- Follow semantic versioning: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- Increment major for breaking changes
- Increment minor for new features
- Increment patch for bug fixes

## Monitoring and Debugging

### GitHub Actions
- View workflow runs in the "Actions" tab
- Check logs for failed builds
- Download build artifacts from successful runs

### Local Testing
```bash
# Simulate the CI pipeline locally
./scripts/android-dev.sh ci-local

# Check specific issues
./scripts/android-dev.sh lint
```

### Common Issues
1. **Test Failures**: Check test reports in workflow logs
2. **Build Failures**: Verify Gradle configuration
3. **Lint Issues**: Run lint locally and fix reported issues
4. **Release Failures**: Ensure proper tag format and permissions

## Next Steps

### Enhancements to Consider
1. **Code Coverage**: Add Jacoco for coverage reports
2. **Static Analysis**: Add additional static analysis tools
3. **Security**: Add security scanning for dependencies
4. **Performance**: Add performance testing automation
5. **App Signing**: Set up proper app signing for release builds
6. **Play Store**: Automate Play Store deployment

### Integration with Server
When you add the server component:
1. Create separate workflows for server CI/CD
2. Add integration tests between Android app and server
3. Consider using Docker for server deployment
4. Add database migration testing

## Contributing
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass locally
4. Create PR with descriptive title and description
5. Wait for automated checks to pass
6. Request code review

This CI/CD setup provides a solid foundation for Android development with automated testing, building, and releasing. The pipeline ensures code quality and makes the release process smooth and reliable.
